Named Entity Recognition , Sentiment Analysis and Emotion Prediction GUI

Overview
This project is a Python-based graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to perform Named Entity Recognition (NER), sentiment analysis, and emotion prediction based on user-provided text. The application leverages an API to process the input text and deliver accurate results using advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Features
Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identifies and classifies key entities in the text, such as people, organizations, and locations.
Sentiment Analysis: Analyzes the sentiment of the input text, determining whether it is positive, negative, or neutral.
Emotion Prediction: Predicts the emotions expressed in the text, including joy, sadness, anger, fear, and surprise.
User-friendly GUI: An intuitive interface that allows users to input text and view results easily.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Required libraries:
tkinter (for GUI)
requests (for API calls)
Other libraries as needed for NER, sentiment analysis, and emotion prediction.
